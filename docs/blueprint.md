## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4285F4) to convey trustworthiness and inspiration. 
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5), creating a clean and neutral backdrop to showcase the color palettes.
- Accent color: Analogous light purple (#673AB7), creating contrast without disrupting visual harmony.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and neutral aesthetic suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Minimalist icons for controls like lock/unlock, add, delete, and export. Icons should be easily recognizable and consistent throughout the application.
- The main layout should feature a prominent display of the color palette with easily accessible controls (spacebar prompt, lock icons, adjustment triggers). Use a minimalist design to allow the colors to stand out.
- Subtle animations for color changes, locking/unlocking, reordering, and modal openings to provide a delightful user experience.
